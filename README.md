HEY DON'T MESS WITH THE MASTER BRANCH, ONLY ALTER YOUR OWN BRANCHES

# HOW TO SWITCH TO YOUR OWN BRANCH:
git checkout (your branch name)

# HOW TO PUSH TO YOUR OWN BRANCH:
git push origin (your branch name)

# HOW TO MAKE A PULL REQUEST:
1. go to the master branch
2. click "new pull request"
3. THE BASE SHOULD BE "MASTER" and you should be COMPARING TO YOUR BRANCH
  base master ... compare vincent

# IF YOU MESS SOMETHING UP REVERT
each push will have a unique code to it, you can find it in your own branch
git revert --hard (PUSH ID)
